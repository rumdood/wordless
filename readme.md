# Wordless

This is a terrible Wordle engine clone that serves no purpose. Everyone got very excited about Wordle and since I've been trying to practice some algorithms I thought it might be fun to try to implement a Wordle engine and maybe a Wordle Solving Enging.

Current implementation is .NET/C#. I may add different implementations in other languages for fun. Feedback other than the fact that this is trash and I'm trash is welcome.
